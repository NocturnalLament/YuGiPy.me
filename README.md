# Yu-Gi-Py
A tool for the YuGiOh Trading Card Game By Konami written in Go with love ðŸ’œ

This is a project whos main purpose is for me to add to in public and hold myself accountable to consistently commit my projects to version control. Also- I have a habit of never making anything public so I'm going to just start coding in public now.

I've only started Go a few months or so ago so and am always wanting to improve so I'm very interested in receiving feedback to get better! So if you have any suggestions for improvement or advice with my code as I go along, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you! ðŸ˜€
